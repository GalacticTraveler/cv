          <em><strong>Web Developer</strong></em>
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a Web Developer. I'm a fan of all things educational (tools, media,
          , courses, applications) that bring me closer to achieving whatever goals or
          aspirations I set for myself. I am very fond of design in the sense
          that I think aesthetics play a major role in a person's willingness to
          engage with a business/company's website or application, since it provides
          most people's first impression. I believe that to portray a message
          acurately through beauty and design, and on a website with full functionality is a
          valuable skill worth spending time on and strengthening.
        </p>
        <p>
          Technology, Art/Crafting, and Plants make me smile.
